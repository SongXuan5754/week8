What is the role of the permanent magnet in a motor?
Permanent magnet around the edge if the motor case remains static.
What is the role of the brushes in a DC motor?
Brushes are a pair of loose connectors, which carry current to commutator.

Imagine you have a robot and want that robot to scan the room for obstacles to decide how to move around. You have a proximity sensor that measures distance. What type of motor might you use to rotate the proximity sensor to scan the room -- a DC motor, a stepper motor, or a servo motor? Why?
Servo motor. Because servo motor was build by some feedback. It can detect the distance and obstacles precisely.
